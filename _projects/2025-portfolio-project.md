A residential air conditioning (AC) system is a closed-loop system designed to take heat from an indoor space and move it to an outdoor space. It operates continuously with steady-state conditions and is commonly modeled as a control volume (CV) having steady mass flow. The system relies on phase changes, pressure differences, and inputting mechanical work to transfer heat from cold to hot, against the natural direction.
