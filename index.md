## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a Mechanical Engineering student focused on understanding how real engineering systems actually work, not just how they are idealized on paper. I am interested in thermodynamic systems, energy conversion, and performance tradeoffs, and I enjoy analyzing how changes in design or operating conditions affect efficiency, output, and losses. This portfolio highlights my approach to modeling physical systems clearly, logically, and with an emphasis on real-world behavior.

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
